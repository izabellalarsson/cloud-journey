# Cloud Journey

This repository documents my journey as I broaden my skills towards backend and cloud development.  
Iâ€™ll be updating it along the way during this fall.

## Next session

- [ ] Deploy my first Lambda function to AWS

## Future sessions

- [ ] Add API Gateway in front of the Lambda
- [ ] Store and retrieve data from DynamoDB
- [ ] Define infrastructure with IaC (Terraform or AWS CDK)
- [ ] Write a short blog post about the experience
